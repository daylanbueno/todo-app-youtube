## todoApp

This is my todoApp project, a simple and practical application developed in Java 17 and Spring Boot. The primary goal of this project is to serve as a demonstration of hexagonal architecture in a real-world context.

#### Tecnologies
- Java  17
- Spring boot
- H2 database

Created for a video on my channel with the aim of explaining hexagonal architecture and how it works in detail.
